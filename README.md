## Usage

`Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)` is an agile software development approach that encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders. It focuses on the behavior of the application from the end user's perspective.

`Cucumber` is a popular BDD tool that allows to write executable specifications in plain text, often referred to as Gherkin syntax.

`Feature files:` In BDD with Cucumber, we start by creating feature files. These files describe the desired behavior of the application in a simple, human-readable language. A service file usually contains one or more scenarios that outline specific use cases.

`Steps:` The scenarios defined in the service files are implemented as step definitions in the code. The step definitions were written in the Java programming language. These steps map plain-text Gherkin steps to the actual code that interacts with the application.

`Test runner: `A test runner is required to run the Cucumber tests. A test runner is a Java class that associates its service files with step definitions. Starts test execution and generates reports.

`Implementation of steps:` In the step definitions, we used Selenium to interact with the website.

`Parameterization:` Parameters were used in Gherkin steps, allowing step definitions to be reused for different inputs. We tested login with different valid and invalid credentials.

`Reporting:` Cucumber generates easy-to-read reports that provide information about test results and scenario status. These reports help you identify problems or errors.
